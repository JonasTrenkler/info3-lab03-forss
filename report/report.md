# Exercise 03 - Python Project

Group: Aaron Rau, Jonas Trenkler
TODO: Add link to repository

## Part 0: Pitch and Group Selection

Aaron pitched an idea for a python script that provides an RSS or Atom feed for a website that does not already do that.
This sounded like a fun project to work on as some steps are necessary to do that.
At the least, it needs to get the contents of a website, parse it to extract the relevant contents and then write a valid XML file that a reader can digest.

## Part 1: Use Cases

TODO: insert use case diagram and textual description

## Part 2: Brief Design

TODO: document design discussion and decision to start with a prototype script and a static, hard-coded website
TODO: add overview of the prototype
TODO: add design of the actual program, even though it might not be implemented

## Part 3: Development

TODO: describe setup of repository, pipenv, dependencies, black
TODO: describe development steps for prototype
